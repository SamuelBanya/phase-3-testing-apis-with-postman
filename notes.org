To make a sample 'POST' request like the video, I ensured that the headers included the following in Postman:
- Content-Type: application/json

I then ensured the 'Body' of the request was 'raw' > 'JSON', and then included the following inside of the 'body' of the request:
#+BEGIN_SRC json
{
    "title": "foo",
    "body": "bar",
    "userId": 1
}
#+END_SRC

This resulted in the following JSON response:
#+BEGIN_SRC json
{
    "title": "foo",
    "body": "bar",
    "userId": 1,
    "id": 101
}
#+END_SRC
